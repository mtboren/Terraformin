# Terraformin — Terraform learning repo

A small learning repository for practicing Terraform on AWS. This project follows the HashiCorp tutorial [Get started with Terraform on AWS](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started) and contains a minimal example configuration in the `somePlan` folder.

### Purpose
- **Learning:**: Hands-on practice with Terraform fundamentals (`init`, `plan`, `apply`, `destroy`, state, and providers).
- **Example:**: Minimal AWS example kept in `somePlan` so you can experiment safely and incrementally.
